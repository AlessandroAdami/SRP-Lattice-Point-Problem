    "This work was done during the summer reading program (SRP) at the University of British Columbia Mathematics department. The aim of the SRP is to introduce undergraduate students to topics that usually are not covered until graduate level. The topic we specifically devled into is the lattice point problem (LPP).\n",

    "The problem can be describe as below. Let $tD$ be the disk of radius $t$ in the $\\R^2$ plane (i.e. $D$ is the unit disk, etc.). Let\n",
    "\n",
    "$$N(t) := \\#\\{tD \\cap \\Z^2\\}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So $N(t)$ is the number of lattice points contained in the disk of radius $t$. Intuitively, $N(t) \\approx \\pi t^2$ or $N(t) = \\pi t^2 + E(t)$. The goal is then to find a bound for $E(t)$. This version of problem (also referred to as the \"Gauss Circle\" problem) is the one we focused on, but there are many different version that consider other shapes and dimensions.\n",
